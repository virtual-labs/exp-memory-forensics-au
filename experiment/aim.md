<h3>Aim of the Experiment</h3>
The aim of this experiment is to explore memory forensics by analyzing memory dumps to extract critical data such as usernames, password hashes, and cached files. It focuses on the volatile nature of RAM and demonstrates how live memory analysis can reveal sensitive information valuable for forensic investigations.

<h3>Applications</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Incident Response:</strong> Memory forensics plays a crucial role in responding to security incidents by uncovering malware traces, user credentials, and active processes that may not be present on disk.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Credential Theft Investigation:</strong> Extracting password hashes from memory can help in identifying unauthorized access or compromised user accounts.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Malware Detection:</strong> Volatile memory often contains traces of malware that donâ€™t leave evidence on the hard disk. This method helps detect and analyze in-memory-only threats.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Digital Forensics:</strong> Enables deeper investigation into user activity, cached files, and volatile artifacts, supporting evidence gathering in forensic cases.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Data Recovery:</strong> Cached files and other remnants found in memory dumps can be recovered even if they were not saved to disk, aiding in recovery of temporary or unsaved data.
  </li>
</ul>
