<u><h3> Procedure</h3></u>

<p>To illustrate the procedural demonstration  between conventional databases and blockchain databases, we have designed a use case focused on product purchases. In this practical exercise, users engage by inputting their purchase specifics, including product name and pricing .After each transaction is concluded, users receive a transaction receipt. The critical aspect of this exercise lies in the concurrent recording of transaction histories in both conventional and blockchain databases.Through this procedure, users will gain a comprehensive understanding of the different  features and characteristics of conventional and blockchain databases. </p>
